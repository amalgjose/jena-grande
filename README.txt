  Jena Grande is a collection of utilities, experiments and examples on 
  how to use MapReduce, Pig, HBase and Giraph to process RDF data.

  RDF data model is a labelled directed multigraph. URIs are used to give 
  globally unique names to nodes and labels. A destination node (a.k.a. an
  object in an RDF statement) can be an attibute value (a.k.a. literal).
  Nodes can also be unnamed (a.k.a. blank nodes).

  Apache Jena is a Java library, currently in incubation and about to 
  graduate, to help you parse, store and query RDF data.  

  This is very much work in progress and if you have experience with 
  processing RDF data with any of the Hadoop ecosystem's projects above
  feel free to fork this and submit your pull requests sharing your 
  experience.

  If the graph you need to process ins't RDF, some of the tricks shared
  here might be useful to you anyway.

  Have fun!
